<h1>The best movies according to Samuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Powder</h3>
<p>Possibly my most loved movie of all time, everything from the acting to the musical score is absolutely top notch.<br>
Highly recommended.</p>
<h3>Boondock Saints</h3>
<p>Another excellent movie boasting a star studded cast and outstanding musical score, action packed, funny, emotional.<br>
Worth noting that Sean Patrick Flanery is in the above 2 movies.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Once again, the soundtrack is worth mentioning here, the composition is second to none.<br>
The story itself is compelling and relevent in this day and age, it's easy to sympathise with the chatacters thanks to the amazing effort of the actors.<br>
It has been mentioned that the digital representation of the blackhole has been called "A Triumph of Visual Effects and Theoretical Physics".</p>
